# AI_Topics_Projects


This repository contains projects completed as part of the AI Topics and Projects course. The key projects include:

1. ##Linear Regression Project
   - Built a linear regression model to predict car prices.
   - Data preprocessing included handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
   - Model evaluation was performed using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

2. ##SVM Classifier Project
   - Developed an SVM classifier to predict customer churn.
   - Data preprocessing included handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
   - Utilized grid search for hyperparameter tuning and evaluated model performance using classification metrics.
